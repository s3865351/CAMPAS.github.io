    <p>We have chosen to name our group Campas. It is simply an acronym of our names, incorporating everyone in the team.</p>

  <h2 class="headingsub">Personal Information</h2>
    <h3>Connor Edmunds #S3872028</h3>
  <p><img src="ConnorEdmunds.jpg" style="max-width:250px;height:auto" alt="Connor Edmunds"></p>
    <p>My interests in IT came at a young age when I was excited by any technology that I could get my hands on. Slowly my passion became more honed, I got my first computer and quickly became the families go to IT fixer. I studied more and more until starting my Cisco Course for Highschool. From studying networks in high school, to messing around with tech outside of class, every part of the industry fascinates me. My interest in IT began when I was young, as my father has a background in IT software, which exposed me to newer and newer technologies as time went on, that spurred me on to seek out more knowledge by myself.</p>
    <h3>Adriaan Moorcroft #S3865351</h3>
  <p><img src="AdriaanMoorcroft.png" style="max-width:250px;height:auto" alt="Adriaan Moorcroft"></p>
    <p>I am 23 years old with South African background. I can speak 2 languages and have a brief education in Mechanical Engineering. To me, IT has always been interesting. Since the age of 5-6 I would always spend as much time as I could learning more about IT. I started out on my dad’s Windows XP computer writing my name in font size 72. I then built my dad’s business computers with his IT consultant when I was 9. I still do not feel informed and capable to do as much as I would like to. I am very interested in App development, software creation and hardware solutions to make everyday life easier.</p>
    <h3>Matthew Hallyburton #S3872398</h3>
  <p><img src="MatthewHallyburton.png" style="max-width:250px;height:auto" alt="Matthew Hallyburton"></p>
    <p>I am an avid sailor with over 20 years' experience and served 6 years in the army. I completed my Cert III in Heavy Vehicle Road Transport and my Cert IV in Engineering (Fluid Power) during my time in the Army. I completed my Cert III in Light Automotive Technologies last year while working for Warrnambool Toyota. My main interest in IT would be computer hardware. As I undertake system integration for customers, keeping up to date with current hardware options is a must. My interest in IT started approximately around the age of 7 when I was given a small DIY, build a computer kit for my birthday. Since then I started building and upgrading PC’s as a hobby, which turned into a side job after I discharged from the Army. My experience in IT has been mostly limited to the hardware side of the industry.</p>
    <h3>Paula Thompson #S3875762</h3>
  <p><img src="PaulaThompson.png" style="max-width:250px;height:auto" alt="Paula Thompson"></p>
    <p>I was born in Chile and immigrated to Australia with my parents at the age of 4.  I have completed all my education in Australia.  I am fluent in Spanish.  I am married, live in south west Sydney and have 2 teenage daughters and 2 dogs. I moved around in a few roles and eventually ended up in a team which was called ISBU (internet & service provider business unit).  Working in this team we delivered data/mobile services to wholesalers and service providers. My interest in IT was generated while working there and becoming a sme in Ethernet international product.  I spent considerable time working through process problems with the product manager. I often felt that the only difference between us was he had a degree and felt that the lack of formal qualifications was holding me back from achieving more in my work life.</p>
    <h3>Alexander Moore #S3871505</h3>
  <p><img src="Alex_Moore.jpg" style="max-width:250px;height:auto" alt="Alexander Moore"></p>
    <p>I was born in Alice Springs NT, and moved to Brisbane when I was 6 years old. I have worked in the hospitality industry for over 10 years now, doing everything from housekeeping and bartending, to functions supervising and restaurant management. My last job was a night manager position for 2 years at a large backpacker’s hostel with bar attached. My interest in IT started when I was very young playing video games and has only grown over the years, but unfortunately my experience in IT is a little lacklustre so far. I play guitar and other instruments and even studied an Audio Engineering and Sound Production course a while back.</p>
    <h3>Sarah Vogler #S3762988</h3>
  <p><img src="SarahVogler.png" style="max-width:250px;height:auto" alt="Sarah Vogler"></p>
    <p>I am currently completing my second year of my Bachelor of Business – Logistics and Supply Chain Management at RMIT. I have accumulated a collection of Diplomas and Certificates over the years; Logistics, Customs Brokerage and Aviation Security are just a few. I really enjoy reading and writing, and I even attended the FIATA World Congress 2018 as a delegate and guest speaker, in New Dehli, India. I am eager to learn and establish how software can communicate with one another to enable business operations to run smoothly and cohesively to provide the most effective outcome. I have always had an interest in IT, but can safely admit, it has increased by far since beginning my Bachelor’s Degree in 2018. This is because my course is through an online forum and requires me to utilize an array of software and websites to complete my degree.</p>
    <h2 class="headingsub">Personality Tests & Traits</h2>
    <h3>Connor</h3></p>
    <p>The Myers-Briggs Test shows I am a Turbulent Mediator – INFP-T Diplomat.
The outcome of these results is scarily true, the more I read the more I aligned with everything it was saying, being from work habits, work and life flow balance, friendship. I think this would benefit, working as a small group, as I tend to thrive in that area, I’m wanting everyone to do well in the group. I think this would benefit, working as a small group, as I tend to thrive in that area, I’m wanting everyone to do well in the group, but also learn and grow more, as I’m more than happy to help anyone even if I’m not sure what the answer is myself.</p>
    <p>The Learning Styles Test shows I am 32.6% Pragmatist, 32.6% Reflector, 25.8% Theorist and 9% Activist.
I really do like to stand back observe and see how everything is done, then reflect on what I have seen and make my own decisions and conclusions, sometimes a considerable amount of time and effort are required to develop these ideas. I think the results from this test show that I would be good with discussions, showcase/demonstrations, feedback from others and coaching. Having a group discussion to find out what people have sound knowledge and fill in the gaps, I would not push someone away if they came to me looking for help.
</p>
    <p>The Big 5 Personality Traits Test shows I am predominantly Agreeable and Conscientious towards others.</p>
    <p>The results for this test show that I’m clearly an introvert, that doesn’t have great emotional stability, am generally agreeable, but at the same time conscientious of my actions, but also approaching the situation with intellect and imagination. It might be a little hard for me to keep communication with people, as my introversion and emotional instability might not agree sometimes, thus making me hard to contact. Try to not let my emotions get in the way too much when it comes to uni work. Take breaks every so often to not let everything get too over whelming. Let the other members know that I am prone to sudden drops in mood.</p>
    <p style="text-align:right;"><img src="Connormyersbriggstest.png" style="max-width:310px;height:auto" alt="Connors myers-briggs test"></p>
  <h3>Adriaan</h3></p>
    <p>Being a Tactile learner, the jobs I would find most useful and appealing would be those that require me to do something. Thus, jobs such as IT repairs, software and hardware development and IT integration would be best suited to me. Additionally, as a Campaigner, I am very curious and observant, which would help me to see things others may miss and offer unique perspectives in the workplace. However, I do find it difficult to focus on tasks that I find little value in, so being aware of this would help in responding to the issue should it arise. From the OCEAN test, I also found that I was very agreeable and conscientious, meaning that I would be able to help and support those around me, whilst being able see the big picture.</p>
    <p>My results indicate that I favour being in more of a leadership role. This would impact my behaviour within a team as I would try to lead and organise the people to complete a task in an efficient way. As an extraverted person, working in a team would suit me as I can communicate and bounce ideas off of others. However, I do like to work independently, as described in the Myers-Briggs test. This may impact my ability to work collaboratively in a team as I would want to have my own role and not share a role with someone else. As a leader, I would use my position to the benefit of the team, not myself. If I were in a team where I could not take a leadership role, this may cause me to feel boxed in and numb my creativity. As a Campaigner, this would be very difficult as it would lead me to become less focused and enthused.</p>
    <p>When forming a team, I should make sure that I am not trying to do the same role as someone else. Rather, I would clearly define and understand the role that I have and the roles of the team members. I would be aware of my tendencies towards others and adapt to the circumstances to help those around me so we could succeed together as a team. From the Myers-Briggs test, I found that as a Campaigner, I have a keen ability to compliment the communication and experiences of those around me whilst offering exciting and unique ideas to projects. Campaigners are excellent communicators and are very approachable, so I would be able to get to know those around me well and make them feel comfortable in the work environment.</p>
    <p style="text-align:right;"><img src="Adriaanmyersbriggstest.png" style="max-width:360px;height:auto" alt="Adriaans myers-briggs test"></p>
  <h3>Matthew</h3></p>
    <p>The defining characteristics of integrity, practical logic and tireless dedication to duty make Logisticians a vital core to many families, as well as organizations that uphold traditions, rules and standards, such as law offices, regulatory bodies and military. </p>
    <p>The results of my tests were very consistent based on how I work and interact with those around me. I am acutely aware of my weak points when it comes these tests as it is something that I discovered during my training in the Army. During my leadership courses and other subject courses we conducted more in-depth testing around our learning and leadership style. It was during these courses that it was pointed out to me that I have excellent leadership qualities, but I need to be far more aware of what my team's capabilities are and to make sure that communicate better with those around me. This is something I have been working towards improving on during and after my time in the Army. </p>
    <p>These results may end up having a negative impact on certain types of required teamwork. I am a very dominant personality and work better when I oversee a group. If another member of my group has a similar personality type to myself, we could end up clashing and not being productive. Ideally, I would be in a group where I could delegate tasks to those who were best fitted for that role, while also providing my own input in other areas. If I am unable to fill the role, I am best suited to, I understand the requirement to adapt to my group’s needs. Although the above paragraph seems to reflect negatively upon myself, this does not mean I am unable to work with others. Putting the groups needs before my own is something that I have worked extremely hard on in the last 4 years. </p>
    <p style="text-align:right;"><img src="Mattmyersbriggstest.png" style="max-width:330px;height:auto" alt="Matthews Myers-briggs test"></p>
<h3>Paula</h3></p>
    <p>The results of the various tests consolidate many personality traits that I realise I have but do not think too deeply about.  They reaffirm what I believe some of my skills are and assist in writing cover letters and resumes around my strengths. I believe I am a team player, and the personality tests seem to agree with that.  I just want to get things done, completed to a high standard and would do well to find other similar minded people. I would struggle with disorganisation and chaos and would start assigning tasks, this may or may not go down well, however due to being time-poor. I don’t think we have the time to pander to disorganisation.</p>
    <p>Openness 67%: Openness describes a person’s tendency to think in abstract, complex ways. High scorers tend to be creative, adventurous, and intellectual.
Conscientiousness 79%: Conscientiousness describes a person’s ability to exercise self-discipline and control in order to pursue their goals. High scorers are organized and determined and are able to forego immediate gratification for the sake of long-term achievement.</p>
    <p>Extraversion 54%:  Extraversion describes a person’s inclination to seek stimulation from the outside world, especially in the form of attention from other people. Extraverts engage actively with others to earn friendship, admiration, power, status, excitement, and romance. Introverts, on the other hand, conserve their energy, and do not work as hard to earn these social rewards.</p>
    <p>Agreeableness 73%: Agreeableness describes a person’s tendency to put others’ needs ahead of their own, and to cooperate rather than compete with others. People who are high in Agreeableness experience a great deal of empathy and tend to get pleasure out of serving and taking care of others. They are usually trusting and forgiving.</p>
    <p>Agreeableness experience a great deal of empathy and tend to get pleasure out of serving and taking care of others. They are usually trusting and forgiving.</p>
    <p>Neuroticism 31%:  Neuroticism describes a person’s tendency to experience negative emotions, including fear, sadness, anxiety, guilt, and shame. While everyone experiences these emotions from time to time, some people are more prone to them than others.</p>
    <p style="text-align:right;"><img src="Paulamyersbriggstest.png" style="max-width:360px;height:auto" alt="Paulas myers-briggs test"></p>
    <p></p>
<h3>Alexander</h3></p>
    <p>The Campaigner personality seems to be a free spirit. As described in the test results, a Campaigner can often be the life of a party but is more interested in the social and emotional connections they make with people, rather than the sheer excitement of the moment. I believe for me; this test shows that while I can sometimes be quiet and reserved, thinking more with my heart than my brain, I can still be quite confident, calm and collect in many situations. This can be a beneficial trait for creating and working in teams, as I can find it easy to empathize with others it is easy for me to get to know people on a personal level, making it easier to connect and express ideas and solutions between each other. Downsides to the Campaigner personality can be finding it difficult to focus, being easily distracted or overthink things too much. I can also sometimes start working independently, drawing focus away from the group.</p>
    <p>The Learning Styles Test through Emtrain.eu indicated that I am mostly a Reflector and an Activist. Emtrain describes Reflectors as those who tend to be more cautious who prefer to stand back and observe. They take the time to collect and interpret information to help them reach their goals. Reflectors usually look at the big picture by gathering information from previous experience as well as current study. With working in groups, Reflectors work best with paired discussions and demonstrations. I believe this is quite accurate, as I do tend to be more cautious and take the time to observe while collecting information.</p>
    <p>The Leadership Style Quiz by the University of Southern California states that I am a Postmodern Leader. A Postmodern Leader is someone who understands that leadership requires both logic and creativity. They see true human potential, and the role of a leader can be enjoyable. The Postmodern Leadership style is a valuable commodity for improving possible career outcomes. When forming and working in a group, the confidence of a leader and aspiration to help others can be very beneficial. One problem with a Postmodern Leader working in groups is ego. Sometimes I can feel the need to be the one in control, or even sometimes dismiss other opinions.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><img src="Alexmyersbrigsstest.png" style="max-width:290px;height:auto" alt="Alexanders Myers-briggs test"></p>
<h3>Sarah</h3></p>
    <p>Myer-Briggs Test -Being described as a protagonist, this generally means that I am a natural-born leader with a strong personality. I am passionate about what I do and strive to understand not only myself, but others around me and genuinely show an interest in people. I am constantly motivated to improve myself and my skills and tend to seek stimulating challenges and experiences.</p>
    <p>What’s Your Learning Style? –My results imply that I am a visual learner. This means I understand and remember things mainly by sight and I generally am organised and neat when it comes to learning. It also means that can easily be distracted by sounds and can have some trouble with spoken instructions.</p>
    <p>Big Five Personality Test –This test, noted that I was outgoing and social, optimistic and friendly, but that my imagination tends to be conventional and I can often be impulsive.</p>
    <p>It is clear that I have a strong personality and may come off as assertive, but is it met with genuine intentions. For the most part of previous group projects I have taken lead, completing more of the complex tasks and finalising the assignments on behalf of others. This has come without hesitation and realisation of what I am doing.</p>
    <p>Knowing that I have these personality traits, has made me realise I need to step back and work more cohesively with my group and take others ideas into account. As IT is a new topic for me, I feel less inclined to take charge and more inclined to learn and contribute.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><img src="Sarahmyersbriggstest.png" style="max-width:290px;height:auto" alt="Sarahs myers-briggs test"></p>

<h3>Working together as a team</h3>
<p>Our group Campas is made up of 6 unique individuals. While some of our personality traits and learning styles are quite similar to each other, like leadership qualities and confidence working with others, we all seem to have a wide range of strengths and weaknesses between us. When looking at the personality tests for everyone, it was apparent that we all share some specific attributes, while in other areas some of us may be more confident than others. We each have our own weaknesses (as indicated in our individual tests) but working as a group we should be able to match those weaknesses with others’ strengths and all help each other.</p>
<p>We have all been shown to have confident personalities when it comes to working in groups; we are comfortable communicating and sharing, and not too shy to ask questions. As expected from our learning styles tests, forming this group was quick and easy, everyone was on-board and eager to learn right from the start.</p>

  <h1 class="headingmain">Ideal Jobs</h1>
  <p>Campas is comprised of people with a broad spectrum of interests and potential career paths. Though all of us are looking at careers that incorporate different elements of IT, we all aspire to achieve different goals. Most of our desired careers are focused on different forms of engineering, from networking and operations, to sound production and systems engineering. </p>
  <p>Connor is looking to be a Network engineer. A Network Engineer is responsible for managing a network, having a background in networking, routing and security. “The job is appealing to me as it utilises previously known skills and places me in an environment that would enable me to constantly develop my skills. To start with a plan on working towards the qualifications I need for the job, I would need to gain more experience with switching protocols used in an Enterprise setting, gaining a professional certification for CCNP, hopefully an internship once I have the qualifications necessary.”</p>
  <p>Adriaan wishes to be a Senior Systems Engineer. An essential element of supporting learning and innovation along with College operations, is a committed team of technical service professionals.  The Senior Systems Engineer is a middle leadership role and will play a pivotal part in the recently formed Knowledge Services team (combined ICT and Information Services). The Senior Systems Engineer will be an enthusiastic and skilled IT professional, with experience and a passion for serving the teaching learning and operations of a dynamic and innovative school.  They will see this role as an opportunity to partner with a great leadership team in making a positive change to our IT operations across the organisation, committed to maintaining a growth mindset and actively exhibiting the character and attributes of a lifelong learner. </p>
  <p>Matthews ideal job would to be an Operating System Engineer. “The role requirements for this job are a bachelor’s degree in IT but ideally, I would prefer to further my studies before undertaking this role. Personally, I would like to complete my master’s degree of Information Technology to further my knowledge in the field. The operating system engineer role links my passion for computer hardware with the software requirements of operating systems. I have some amount of knowledge of the hardware requirements for some specialised systems such as NAS, raid setups, server hardware, etc but I lack the knowledge needed to perform troubleshooting and diagnosis of the software systems.”</p>
  <p>Paula is aspiring to be a Solutions Architect. “Digital innovation role to work with customers help solve problem or opportunity that they deem significant in their community/domain and that relies at least partially on information technologies. The Solution Architect plays a critical role by applying the latest cloud computing technologies, application architectures, and integration approaches to each Digital Innovation engagement. I find this appealing because I want to learn more about cloud technology and understand at a deeper level what solution architects do and how they devise individualised solutions for a specific client requirement.”</p>
  <p>Alexander is striving to be an Audio Engineer. An Audio Engineer is a trained professional who works with the mechanics of recording, mixing and reproducing sound. They can work in many different areas from recording and mixing music in studios, handling the technical aspects and sound levels of live gigs/festivals, and even audio design and production for video games and movies. “I have developed an interest in audio engineering ever since I could pick up a guitar. As much as I wanted to play music, I also loved the idea of sharing music, which got me on the idea of recording and mixing. After learning a lot about music in school, and many years of random experiences since, I found that audio engineering encompasses a lot of my biggest interest, like music (live and mixed) and video games.”</p>
  <p>Sarah is working towards being a Supply Chain Business Operations Manager. Supply Chain Managers are responsible for overseeing and managing company’s overall supply chain and logistics strategy and operations in order to maximize the process efficiency and productivity. In addition, they play a crucial role in developing and maintaining good relationships with vendors and distributors. “Working as a customs broker, my role is just one aspect of many supply chains. This position appeals to me, as it will identify how a particular supply chain operates from start to finish and what is involved in operations across the whole supply chain.”</p>

  <h2 class="headingsub">Group Skill Set</h2>
  <p>From our Groups ideal jobs, will break it up into 2 parts, being General Skills, and IT- specific skills. Our groups general skills set consists of Communication skills, for talking to customers or communicating your point effectively to team members or co-workers to achieve the best result without conflict. Problem solving and troubleshooting will come into play a lot with typically the Engineer roles, but with other non-IT based roles it ties in nicely with communication skills. Teamwork/ Collaborations and time management bundle well, as if you can manage your time well and work in a team, bigger projects can general be completed faster. Some of the other skills required outside of the IT based roles are skills really needed in areas such as; building effective communications as this will help any business manager to maintain business relations for considerably longer, or being detail-oriented in the music industry would help to pick up the little things that most might miss.</p>

  <h2 class="headingsub">Autonomous Vehicles</h2>
  <h3>What is it and what does it do? </h3>
  <p>As artificial intelligence expands, fragments of our favourite sci-fi media creations are injected into real life, with the most highly anticipated technological advance being the idea of autonomous vehicles. To put it in more simple terms, vehicles capable of operating without any human involvement. But, do we really need them? Short answer, yes, we do. Globally, it is estimated that approximately 94% of current traffic accidents are caused by human error alone. Autonomous vehicles aim to cut that percentage down to zero. This statistic alone is enough to invest in its development and is the essence of its existence.</p>
  <p>The creation of this concept seems simple enough, create a vehicle that I don’t have to operate. Conversely, when the concept is broken down, you can actually see the level of complexity it comprises. Not only will it take thousands (if not, millions) of man hours to perfect, but a vast selection of industry specialists working together to ensure the safest transition into the future we are developing. From moral and ethical considerations, to legal and safety requirements, it is clear why this technology has not yet been achieved.</p>
  <p>Currently there are five recognised levels of driving automation, with level 1 being mostly human controlled and level 5 being the ultimate objective. Generally speaking, the general public worldwide are sitting at levels 1 and 2 – known as ‘partially automated’. Whilst new vehicle models are being released with advanced technology such as lane-keep assist, cruise control and reversing sensors, we are nowhere near close to being further up on the tier. Level 3 is more progressive, assisting with speed management and steering, road environment monitoring but requires human fall back. Level 4 are again more forward-looking as they are more capable of operating some but not all driving modes, called high automation. Limitations of this level can be caused by factors such as weather conditions or speed. Level 5 driving automation will be required to utilise sensors, GPS, cameras, data, high speed internet connectivity and data processors to enable substantial data collection to be filtered so that the right action can be implicated in a split second to adjust the appropriate control of the vehicle, known as machine learning. This is a highly complex concept that requires static algorithms of inputs and outputs to precisely react to the environment it is in.</p>
  <p>Current research, testing and investment in the private sector means that companies like Waymo and Tesla are at final rollout phases of level 4 automation and are working on prototype testing of fully driverless level 5 vehicles. If these phases are successful, they still need to pass legislation and be written into the road rules of the country they are being developed in. They will also need to be introduced and subsequently co-exist with existing vehicles, some of which are still at a level 0 autonomy, meaning they have no assisted or automated driving technologies, and will need to be able to adjust its capabilities until the infrastructure can be developed and expanded to accommodate a complete fleet of autonomous vehicles.</p>
  <h3>So, what impact are autonomous vehicles likely to have on the economy and society?</h3>
  <p>First of all, it is expected to widely impact the (un)employment rate. Of course, job losses are inevitable but they won’t occur overnight and won’t be as severe as first believed. Yes, drivers will eventually be replaced by this technology but the expansion in various other industries (such as; engineers, technicians, software developers and designers to name a few) will counteract this loss on the unemployment rate. This is a necessary trade off if we, as a society, are to evolve and grow.</p>
  <p>Welfare implications are varied and effect on both positive and negative levels. For example; driverless vehicles can increase mobility to those who are too young, too old or whom are compromised by a disability such as vision or hearing impaired. They can assist occupants who are distracted, intoxicated or those suffering from medical conditions, for instance; seizures. This is all well and good, but it comes at a price. Earlier we mentioned technology that makes up the core platform of an autonomous vehicle, these components require highly auxiliary power from vehicles and therefore create a huge demand for increased energy consumption. A report by the financial review in 2017 claimed, ‘Australia households pay the highest power prices in the world’ which is a concerning position for autonomous vehicles in the Australian market.</p>
  <p>Consumers will also see a reduction in insurance premiums, however, insurance companies and repair contractors are likely to experience a huge decline in business as one of the key aims for autonomous vehicles it to significantly reduce road accidents. Insurance agents will need to develop new policies and models to accommodate the changes to stay afloat and repair agents will need to advance with the times and perhaps expand their physical repairs to a more technology based approach.</p>
  <p>Fuel efficiency is predicted to increase significantly. Drive cycles will run at optimum capacity as the vehicle is able to accelerate and brake more efficiently than their human counterparts. Privacy concerns and terrorist scenarios are also being deliberated as the vehicles location and position needs to be integrated into an interface that others will potentially have access to. This can ultimately land in the wrong hands and lead to unimaginable outcomes. Although these are only estimated predictions, additional impacts are likely to be discovered as further advancements are made.</p>
  <h3>With all of these projected impacts, how will this affect us in our daily life and what repercussions might affect our friends and family?</h3>
  <p>To start with, for us (IT students), this opens up a huge prospect of career outcomes. Although a solid platform for the concept has already been created, there is still an unprecedented amount of work to be completed before level 5 automation can be finalised. Total implementation ready for widespread public use isn’t expected until at least 2036, and collectively will only make up approximately 10% of vehicles on our roads.</p>
  <p>Friends and family who have careers as vehicle operators are likely to be relieved of their duties depending on the industry they operate in. Classified as low-skill works, with their main proficiency being the aptitude to drive, these ‘drivers’ are likely to be substituted for their autonomous equivalents. Obviously autonomous vehicles cannot replace paramedics, fire fighters, police officers or the physical delivery of food or alcohol but they can substitute general human vehicle operators. Workers in these jobs will need to adapt and find a new career path, where they may require further skill development and additional training, which could be difficult to accommodate to.  Having noted the above, the outcome can affect others in a different direction. With an automated service, there is less need to actually own a vehicle yourself with the potential to call a driverless car from a shared fleet platform, reducing the cost of insurance, car registration and overall fuel consumption expenses leading to an increase in home income, but a decrease in the economy.</p>

  <h2 class="headingsub">Cybersecurity</h2>
  <h3>What is it and what does it do? </h3>
  <p>Ah the internet, the vital connection to the entire world. Used for a multitude of elements including (but of course not limited to) socialising, entertainment, connectivity, banking, information sharing, research, study and so on a so forth. “But I thought this piece was about cybersecurity, not the internet?” I hear you question. Technically, you are correct! But, we needed a base to build upon to give you the most concise and simple definition to ascertain potential impacts it can have (if you chose to ignore it) or not have and how it will affect you or your loved ones in day to day life. So, without further ado, let’s jump in!</p>
  <p>With all of the data we feed into the internet, we really need to step back and stress how important it is to protect certain information. Without appropriate security functions, cyber threats or attacks can cause huge losses to individuals, organisations or nations. This is where Cybersecurity comes in. Cybersecurity is the protection of networks, data, programs, hardware, software and other information from unauthorised users.</p>
  <p>We, as humans, are becoming increasingly reliant on computer systems and networks, largely due to the development of ‘smart devices’. These devices operate wirelessly potentially increasing unwanted vulnerabilities. Therefore, it is imperative to note that cybersecurity isn’t motionless. Every day hackers are developing new and more complex ways to breach important information to extort, destroy, steal and cause uninvited disruptions. This is enhanced by technological advancements such as the 5G network and artificial intelligence, which are predicted to define the next decade of global cybersecurity. 5G will not only be the fastest internet network known to date, it will encourage the introduction of approximately 75 billion new devices to connect online every year. Although it seems impressive and will have the capacity to further connect the world, it will also open the door to a huge prospect of more advanced cyber threats. These unpredictable outcomes could essentially provide attackers with immediate admission to vulnerable networks. Artificial intelligence is a vital factor for the protection of these threats and need to operate effectively and efficiently to prevent the exploitation of the information available, inevitably posing entirely new problems to global cybersecurity.</p>
  <p>Currently, cybersecurity threats and attacks are monitored by the Parliament of Australia, National Security and Australian Cyber Security Centre (ASSC). Although scrutinized thoroughly, cyber security breaches increase by almost 80% in 2018. This astonishing figure lead to the discovery that more than 60% of Australian organisations don’t have the necessary resources to respond to cyber security attacks. A recent example, also noted to be the most significant breach in 2019 was one of Australia’s top software companies, ‘Canvas’. Where approximately 139 million user profiles were stolen, containing email addresses and locations.</p>
  <p>Whilst difficult to predict future threats, cyber security works to prevent as much leakage as possible, to avoid disastrous consequences. It must also be emphasised that nations need to work together to defeat cyber threats as it is a global issue that affects every nation, government, business and individual.</p>
  <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
  <p>Cybersecurity assists in eliminating radicalism acts known as ‘cyber terrorism’. These pre-meditated, politically motivated attacks, involving computer system and program breaches, are designed to disrupt, wreak havoc and have the potential to paralyse entire nations.  Without effective cybersecurity measures, computer networks are vulnerable and could have dire economic consequences such as, loss of intellectual property, financial fraud, damage to reputation and lower productivity, effectively destroying entire nations.</p>
  <p>It is an ongoing technological innovation that requires skilled cyber security professionals to maintain and support it. The Australian Government has not only assisted in the development of two national cyber security qualifications they are also regulating and implementing strategies (such as ‘Cyber Security Strategy) to ensure Australia’s interests online are protected. Thus, creating continuous growth opportunities for career development. Cyber-threats will never stop occurring, therefore it is essential that cybersecurity measures are continually monitored and evolving.</p>
  <p>La Trobe Universities industry partner Cisco reported “there are currently one million cybersecurity job openings globally”. With a projected demand to increase significantly in the coming years. La Trobe University, 2020 then stipulated, “The rapid evolution of cybercrime means that cybersecurity can no longer be isolated to IT departments – it needs to be addressed across all functions of an organisation or business.”</p>
  <p>Implications of not having adequate cybersecurity can be life altering. For families, protection is essential. Compromised personal information such as photos, basic information, bank details etc. can lead to cybercrimes like identity theft, whereby hackers can make illegal monetary transactions on your behalf, and potentially put you in financial ruins or effectively cause irreparable damage to your image. And, for organisations it can be catastrophic. Breaches in data, resulting in financial loss, business loss, costs or investment loss are all possibilities that adequate cybersecurity could prevent.</p>
  <h3>How will this affect us in our daily lives and how might it affect our friends and family?</h3>
  <p>Cybersecurity is another exciting and ‘hard core’ sub-section of IT that has enormous potential for students (like us) to explore and build rewarding careers in as depicted in the previous section.</p>
  <p>Though it may be a fantastic career choice, if you or someone you know falls victim to a cyber-attack, or the nation in which you reside falls victim to a cyber-terrorist attack it can be devastating to your mental health and wellbeing, an organisations structure and operating capacity or deal significant damage to the economy, resulting in hardship and unemployment.</p>

  <h2 class="headingsub">Clouds, Services and Servers</h2>
  <h3>What is it and what does it do?</h3>
  <p>The technology behind clouds, services and servers has increased exponentially over the course of the last ten years. From Amazon Web Services to Google Drive, there are many different available platforms for end users to utilise. Although it is costly and requires skilled IT staff for the end user to adapt or move their business model from a dedicated server to a cloud model, the trend is that more and more businesses are choosing to adopt the cloud or a hybrid cloud business model. The reasoning behind this is due to many factors, mainly, cost, ease of access, disaster protection and redundancy of hardware.</p>
  <p>Technologies like Kubernetes and hyperscale data centres are at the forefront of cloud computing in both terms of software and hardware. Hyperscale data centers, which are primary operated by the larger companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft, are offering much more than a data centre as a storage solution. These hyperscale data centers can handle an extreme amount of high-volume traffic and heavy computing workloads in comparison to their counterparts. These hyperscale data centres also need to come up with unique cooling solutions in order to keep the storage at an optimal temperature. In order to keep as energy efficient as possible these hyperscale data centres are moving away from the traditional air conditioning and convection based cooling solutions and are adopting water-based cooling solutions.</p>
  <p>Kubernetes is Linux based platform and infrastructure as a service (PaaS and IaaS) which is leading the way in breaking down the walls between cloud providers. It was unfathomable a few years ago that the provider who owns the server rack could be decoupled from the cloud infrastructure software vendor, which is providing some very exciting offerings. Take Google’s Anthos service as an example, it easily able to run on Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure as well as on their own cloud platform.</p>
  <p>To keep hyperscale data centres up to date, the hardware that is at the core of these data centres, needs to be cutting edge. Although the previous statement is true the one thing that has not fundamentally changed is the storage solution itself. Current data centres use Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) as storage and this technology has been around for 65 years with obvious changes in capacity, durability, read/write speeds and size. The availability and low cost of HDDs are the reason they remain the preferred storage solution for data centres. However, with Solid State Drives (SSDs) technology advancing very quickly we could see new data centres start to adopt SSDs as their main storage solution. The main advantages of SSDs over HDDs are performance (read/write speeds), lower energy consumption, reliability, lower noise and less weight.</p>
  <p>Something a bit further on the horizon is the development of five-dimensional (5D) crystal data storage. Since its inception in 2013 it has made massive improvements in storage availability. Early versions of this technology could only hold a few hundred kilobytes (KB) of data now newer discs can hold up to 360 terabytes (TB), comparatively consumer HDDs currently have a max capacity of 20 gigabytes (GB). The idea behind 5D storage is similar to that of a standard compact disc, where a light is reflected off ‘ridges’ etched into the surface to register either a 1 or a 0 within the reading device. This is considered to be two dimensions of data. 5D storage uses a crystal which is etched with microscopic nanograting’s within the glass which alters the way light travels through the glass, providing five different dimensions in which data can be read. Because the 5D storage is made from glass it is far more durable than anything currently on the market, being able to withstand extreme heat without any loss of functionality.</p>
  <h3>What is the potential impact of clouds, services and servers on society?</h3>
  <p>Cloud, services and servers’ impact on our day to day lives is becoming more apparent as the technology develops. One that is most utilised by almost all of us would be internet or mobile banking. Banks are moving away from what is considered to be a traditional banking service and more towards an online bank entity by adopting cloud or hybrid cloud models for their business. This affects both us as the user and the bank as the supplier interact. We have seen mobile banking come a long way in the last few years with ever increasing amounts of functionality. This is not only because of the way banks are moving forward with their technology but how the smartphone industry is evolving as well.</p>
  <p>With the potential of both SSDs and 5D storage, these technologies are likely to have a massive impact on data centres as they strive towards goals such as carbon neutrality.</p>
  <p>As I mentioned previously, platforms like Kubernetes are changing the way that the clouds are interacting with each other. Now you can interact with different software vendors across different servers, which has the potential to change how larger enterprises operate.</p>
  <p>The trend of cloud, services and servers is only going to continue on an upward trajectory as more and more users transfer over to the cloud. Although this has the potential to make legacy servers redundant, they still have a use in hybrid cloud models. As this technology continues to develop it will create more jobs, as more IT professionals will be required to maintain all aspects of clouds, services and servers. From hardware system integrators to Linux kernel software engineers, there is an ever-increasing demand for skilled IT professionals which the supply will need to be filled.</p>
  <h3>How will this impact us as an individual, community and a business?</h3>
  <p>Us as an end user of clouds, services and servers have already felt the impact of these technologies. Most of us will use them on a daily basis, sometimes without even realizing. It makes our day to day lives easier by allowing us to access almost any required information, whether it be online banking or Google drive, from almost anywhere. This goes hand in hand with the development of smart phone technology, which has made everything so accessible.</p>
  <p>These changes in current technology affect me directly as I undertake system integrations for various clients. Understanding the needs of my clients and adapting to the currently available solutions is becoming more difficult due to the choice between legacy servers, hybrid cloud services, direct cloud solutions, etc. I primarily undertake small scale Network Access Storge implementation for clients which incorporates the use of currently available HDD technology. Because this technology is developing so quickly it requires me to do a lot of research on what is the best solution to implement, which may lead me to suggesting that my client may be better off choosing a cloud solution over a legacy server option.</p>
  <p>These services will also affect individuals that are not technologically savvy. People who simply send and receive emails will have their information automatically uploaded to the cloud.</p>

  <h1 class="headingmain">Project Idea</h1>

  <h2 class="headingsub">Overview</h2>

  <p>The project will make it easier for golfers to find their golf balls. The project deliverables consist’ of two parts. One part is a machine that tracks the golf ball and guides the golfer to the ball. The other part is the golf ball that can be easily tracked by the machine. The project will need hardware for at least the machine. The project will need software integrated into the machine for all the needed functionalities that are desired.</p>

  <h2 class="headingsub">Motivation</h2>

  <p>I try each day to help people around me. This course is helping me to be able to use IT to make people’s lives better or easier. I would like to do a project that will help people. Projects with programming and hardware aspects could help me gain required experience and knowledge needed to work in my ideal job.</p>
  <p>In every round of golf played around the world there is a ball hit to a spot that should be “fine” until you cannot find it. I played golf with a retired gentleman, he hit his ball to a lone tree surrounded by grass. I did not even think that there is a chance that the ball cannot be found. To my astonishment after 5 minutes of looking we could not find his golf ball.</p>
  <p>I would like to make a round on the golf course more enjoyable. I would like to help this “fine” golf ball to be found rather than disappear.</p>

  <h2 class="headingsub">Description</h2>

  <p>The project idea is to create a golf ball that can be tracked and more easily found. Two possible methods by which this could be achieved would be through sound or light, or through tracking.</p>
  <p>Sound or light option</p>
  <p>This option involves the golf ball being redesigned to include a speaker or light inside it to be able to use human senses to find it. The ball would play a sound or shine a light for the golfer to hear or see. However, this could impede the quiet nature of golf. Additionally, the effectiveness of this option would be limited as some golfers cannot hear or see well. It would also be difficult to manufacture a light or speaker into the ball with all the strict regulations that are in place for golf balls. Given these insights, this idea would not be optimal.</p>
  <p>Tracking option</p>
  <p>Another option is to include something inside the golf ball to make it possible for a machine to find it. This machine could be a handheld device or a device that is fixed to a golf bag\buggy. It could also be tracked by a smart phone using an app. The golf ball would have a GPS tracker inside it. The device or phone would track the ball and guide the golfer to its location. The location of the ball would be displayed on a course map and as the golfer then arrives in the general area of the ball, an arrow or dot would direct the golfer to the golf ball. Despite the similar difficulties in manufacturing, this option would be more optimal due to the end result being more functional and practical for the user.</p>
  <p>The tracking option is the preferred method of developing this project idea. There are a number of considerations that would need to be addressed for this idea to work effectively. Firstly, the ball would need to conform to ruling regulations. Some of the regulations relate to weight, size, shape and stiffness. Secondly, a GPS tracking chip would need to be made and imbedded into the golf ball that can withstand extreme conditions. Some include withstand high impacts, temperature changes, water and sand. Lastly, an app or tracking device would need to be developed that is user friendly.</p>

  <h2 class="headingsub">Tools and Technologies</h2>

  <p>The two main software and hardware tools required for this project would be the development of a GPS tracking chip to be placed inside the golf ball, and a device or app that the user can use to track the ball’s location.</p>
  <p>GPS inside the golf ball</p>
  <p>The technologies needed to successfully develop the ball would be:</p>
  <p>•	GPS - for tracking</p>
  <p>•	NFC – for charging the ball</p>
  <p>•	Golf ball technology for optimal spin and ball speed</p>
  <p>Device/app</p>
  <p>The software for this would need to be developed to connect to the ball and accurately relay the location of the ball to the user.</p>

  <h2 class="headingsub">Skills Required</h2>

  <p>The skills required would be both in software and hardware fields. The development of the app UI would need skills of coding and programming. The GPS tracking within the app would need to be factored into the app development. The GPS tracking chip would need skills of circuit board design and creation, alongside putting a GPS node on the circuit board. The skill to incorporate NFC charging would also be needed. The skills of designing premium quality golf balls would be required to make the ball a viable replacement for current marketed golf balls whilst not losing performance gains.</p>
  <p>The software for this project is very likely already developed but has not been integrated in this field. It would also be likely that the hardware required is available but again has not been integrated. This would increase the likeliness that this project idea would be very viable.</p>

  <h2 class="headingsub">Outcome</h2>

  <p>If the project is successful, golfers who find it difficult to see their ball, or who often lose their ball will be able to find it easily! Receiving a 2-shot penalty for a lost ball will be no more. This development will have a positive impact on the golfing community as players will enjoy the opportunity to play more often without the hassle and cost of losing of a ball, or multiple. Big companies such as Callaway, TaylorMade and Titleist would most probably want to patent the idea and make a considerable profit from it. It may cause contention amongst professional fields as those who have the trackable ball would be at an advantage. Thus, it may prove difficult to have this ball regulated in competitions as it would need to be approved by PGA associations.</p>
