    <h2 class="headingsub">Personal Information</h2>
    <h3>Connor Edmunds #S3872028</h3>
    <p>My interests in IT came at a young age when I was excited by any technology that I could get my hands on. Slowly my passion became more honed, I got my first computer and quickly became the families go to IT fixer. I studied more and more until starting my Cisco Course for Highschool. From studying networks in high school, to messing around with tech outside of class, every part of the industry fascinates me. My interest in IT began when I was young, as my father has a background in IT software, which exposed me to newer and newer technologies as time went on, that spurred me on to seek out more knowledge by myself.</p>
    <h3>Adriaan Moorcroft #S3865351</h3>
    <p>I am 23 years old with South African background. I can speak 2 languages and have a brief education in Mechanical Engineering. To me, IT has always been interesting. Since the age of 5-6 I would always spend as much time as I could learning more about IT. I started out on my dad’s Windows XP computer writing my name in font size 72. I then built my dad’s business computers with his IT consultant when I was 9. I still do not feel informed and capable to do as much as I would like to. I am very interested in App development, software creation and hardware solutions to make everyday life easier.</p>
    <h3>Matthew Hallyburton #S3872398</h3>
    <p>I am an avid sailor with over 20 years' experience and served 6 years in the army. My main interest in IT would be computer hardware. As I undertake system integration for customers, keeping up to date with current hardware options is a must. My interest in IT started approximately around the age of 7 when I was given a small DIY build a computer kit for my birthday. Since then I started building and upgrading PC’s as a hobby, with later turned into a side job later in life. My experience in IT has been mostly limited to the hardware side of the industry.</p>
    <h3>Paula Thompson #S3875762</h3>
    <p>I was born in Chile and immigrated to Australia with my parents at the age of 4.  I have completed all my education in Australia.  I am fluent in Spanish.  I am married, live in south west Sydney and have 2 teenage daughters and 2 dogs. I moved around in a few roles and eventually ended up in a team which was called ISBU (internet & service provider business unit).  Working in this team we delivered data/mobile services to wholesalers and service providers. My interest in IT was generated while working there and becoming a sme in Ethernet international product.  I spent considerable time working through process problems with the product manager. I often felt that the only difference between us was he had a degree and felt that the lack of formal qualifications was holding me back from achieving more in my work life.</p>
    <h3>Alexander Moore #S3871505</h3>
    <p>I was born in Alice Springs NT, and moved to Brisbane when I was 6 years old. I have worked in the hospitality industry for over 10 years now, doing everything from housekeeping and bartending, to functions supervising and restaurant management. My last job was a night manager position for 2 years at a large backpacker’s hostel with bar attached. My interest in IT started when I was very young playing video games and has only grown over the years, but unfortunately my experience in IT is a little lacklustre so far. I play guitar and other instruments and even studied an Audio Engineering and Sound Production course a while back.</p>
    <h3>Sarah Vogler #S3762988</h3>
    <p>I am currently completing my second year of my Bachelor of Business – Logistics and Supply Chain Management at RMIT. I have accumulated a collection of Diplomas and Certificates over the years; Logistics, Customs Brokerage and Aviation Security are just a few. I really enjoy reading and writing, and I even attended the FIATA World Congress 2018 as a delegate and guest speaker, in New Dehli, India. I am eager to learn and establish how software can communicate with one another to enable business operations to run smoothly and cohesively to provide the most effective outcome. I have always had an interest in IT, but can safely admit, it has increased by far since beginning my Bachelor’s Degree in 2018. This is because my course is through an online forum and requires me to utilize an array of software and websites to complete my degree.</p>
    <h2 class="headingsub">Personality Tests & Traits</h2>
    <h3>Connor</h3></p>
    <p>The Myers-Briggs Test shows I am a Turbulent Mediator – INFP-T Diplomat.
The outcome of these results is scarily true, the more I read the more I aligned with everything it was saying, being from work habits, work and life flow balance, friendship. I think this would benefit, working as a small group, as I tend to thrive in that area, I’m wanting everyone to do well in the group. I think this would benefit, working as a small group, as I tend to thrive in that area, I’m wanting everyone to do well in the group, but also learn and grow more, as I’m more than happy to help anyone even if I’m not sure what the answer is myself.</p>
    <p>The Learning Styles Test shows I am 32.6% Pragmatist, 32.6% Reflector, 25.8% Theorist and 9% Activist.
I really do like to stand back observe and see how everything is done, then reflect on what I have seen and make my own decisions and conclusions, sometimes a considerable amount of time and effort are required to develop these ideas. I think the results from this test show that I would be good with discussions, showcase/demonstrations, feedback from others and coaching. Having a group discussion to find out what people have sound knowledge and fill in the gaps, I would not push someone away if they came to me looking for help.
</p>
    <p>The Big 5 Personality Traits Test shows I am predominantly Agreeable and Conscientious towards others.</p>
    <p>The results for this test show that I’m clearly an introvert, that doesn’t have great emotional stability, am generally agreeable, but at the same time conscientious of my actions, but also approaching the situation with intellect and imagination. It might be a little hard for me to keep communication with people, as my introversion and emotional instability might not agree sometimes, thus making me hard to contact. Try to not let my emotions get in the way too much when it comes to uni work. Take breaks every so often to not let everything get too over whelming. Let the other members know that I am prone to sudden drops in mood.</p>
    <h3>Adriaan</h3></p>
    <p>Being a Tactile learner, the jobs I would find most useful and appealing would be those that require me to do something. Thus, jobs such as IT repairs, software and hardware development and IT integration would be best suited to me. Additionally, as a Campaigner, I am very curious and observant, which would help me to see things others may miss and offer unique perspectives in the workplace. However, I do find it difficult to focus on tasks that I find little value in, so being aware of this would help in responding to the issue should it arise. From the OCEAN test, I also found that I was very agreeable and conscientious, meaning that I would be able to help and support those around me, whilst being able see the big picture.</p>
    <p>My results indicate that I favour being in more of a leadership role. This would impact my behaviour within a team as I would try to lead and organise the people to complete a task in an efficient way. As an extraverted person, working in a team would suit me as I can communicate and bounce ideas off of others. However, I do like to work independently, as described in the Myers-Briggs test. This may impact my ability to work collaboratively in a team as I would want to have my own role and not share a role with someone else. As a leader, I would use my position to the benefit of the team, not myself. If I were in a team where I could not take a leadership role, this may cause me to feel boxed in and numb my creativity. As a Campaigner, this would be very difficult as it would lead me to become less focused and enthused.</p>
    <p>When forming a team, I should make sure that I am not trying to do the same role as someone else. Rather, I would clearly define and understand the role that I have and the roles of the team members. I would be aware of my tendencies towards others and adapt to the circumstances to help those around me so we could succeed together as a team. From the Myers-Briggs test, I found that as a Campaigner, I have a keen ability to compliment the communication and experiences of those around me whilst offering exciting and unique ideas to projects. Campaigners are excellent communicators and are very approachable, so I would be able to get to know those around me well and make them feel comfortable in the work environment.</p>
    <h3>Matthew</h3></p>
    <p>The results of the above tests were very consistent based on how I work and interact with those around me. I am acutely aware of my weak points when it comes these tests as it is something I have been aiming to improve upon after my time in the military.</p>
    <p>These results may end up having a negative impact on certain types of required teamwork. I am a very dominant personality and work better when I oversee a group. If another member of my group has a similar personality type to myself, we would end up clashing and not being productive.</p>
    <p>Ideally, I would be in a group where I could delegate tasks to those who were best fitted for that role, while also providing my own input in other areas. If I am unable to fill the role, I am best suited to, I understand the requirement to adapt to my group’s needs.</p>
    <h3>Paula</h3></p>
    <p>The results of the various tests consolidate many personality traits that I realise I have but do not think too deeply about.  They reaffirm what I believe some of my skills are and assist in writing cover letters and resumes around my strengths. I believe I am a team player, and the personality tests seem to agree with that.  I just want to get things done, completed to a high standard and would do well to find other similar minded people. I would struggle with disorganisation and chaos and would start assigning tasks, this may or may not go down well, however due to being time-poor. I don’t think we have the time to pander to disorganisation.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Alexander</h3></p>
    <p>The Campaigner personality seems to be a free spirit. As described in the test results, a Campaigner can often be the life of a party but is more interested in the social and emotional connections they make with people, rather than the sheer excitement of the moment. I believe for me; this test shows that while I can sometimes be quiet and reserved, thinking more with my heart than my brain, I can still be quite confident, calm and collect in many situations. This can be a beneficial trait for creating and working in teams, as I can find it easy to empathize with others it is easy for me to get to know people on a personal level, making it easier to connect and express ideas and solutions between each other. Downsides to the Campaigner personality can be finding it difficult to focus, being easily distracted or overthink things too much. I can also sometimes start working independently, drawing focus away from the group.</p>
    <p>The Learning Styles Test through Emtrain.eu indicated that I am mostly a Reflector and an Activist. Emtrain describes Reflectors as those who tend to be more cautious who prefer to stand back and observe. They take the time to collect and interpret information to help them reach their goals. Reflectors usually look at the big picture by gathering information from previous experience as well as current study. With working in groups, Reflectors work best with paired discussions and demonstrations. I believe this is quite accurate, as I do tend to be more cautious and take the time to observe while collecting information.</p>
    <p>The Leadership Style Quiz by the University of Southern California states that I am a Postmodern Leader. A Postmodern Leader is someone who understands that leadership requires both logic and creativity. They see true human potential, and the role of a leader can be enjoyable. The Postmodern Leadership style is a valuable commodity for improving possible career outcomes. When forming and working in a group, the confidence of a leader and aspiration to help others can be very beneficial. One problem with a Postmodern Leader working in groups is ego. Sometimes I can feel the need to be the one in control, or even sometimes dismiss other opinions.</p>
    <h3>Sarah</h3></p>
    <p>Myer-Briggs Test -Being described as a protagonist, this generally means that I am a natural-born leader with a strong personality. I am passionate about what I do and strive to understand not only myself, but others around me and genuinely show an interest in people. I am constantly motivated to improve myself and my skills and tend to seek stimulating challenges and experiences.</p>
    <p>What’s Your Learning Style? –My results imply that I am a visual learner. This means I understand and remember things mainly by sight and I generally am organised and neat when it comes to learning. It also means that can easily be distracted by sounds and can have some trouble with spoken instructions.</p>
    <p>Big Five Personality Test –This test, noted that I was outgoing and social, optimistic and friendly, but that my imagination tends to be conventional and I can often be impulsive.</p>
    <p>It is clear that I have a strong personality and may come off as assertive, but is it met with genuine intentions. For the most part of previous group projects I have taken lead, completing more of the complex tasks and finalising the assignments on behalf of others. This has come without hesitation and realisation of what I am doing.</p>
    <p>Knowing that I have these personality traits, has made me realise I need to step back and work more cohesively with my group and take others ideas into account. As IT is a new topic for me, I feel less inclined to take charge and more inclined to learn and contribute.</p>

  <h1 class="headingmain">Project Idea</h1>

  <h2 class="headingsub">Overview</h2>

  <p>The project will make it easier for golfers to find their golf balls. The project deliverables consist’ of two parts. One part is a machine that tracks the golf ball and guides the golfer to the ball. The other part is the golf ball that can be easily tracked by the machine. The project will need hardware for at least the machine. The project will need software integrated into the machine for all the needed functionalities that are desired.</p>

  <h2 class="headingsub">Motivation</h2>

  <p>I try each day to help people around me. This course is helping me to be able to use IT to make people’s lives better or easier. I would like to do a project that will help people. Projects with programming and hardware aspects could help me gain required experience and knowledge needed to work in my ideal job.</p>
  <p>In every round of golf played around the world there is a ball hit to a spot that should be “fine” until you cannot find it. I played golf with a retired gentleman, he hit his ball to a lone tree surrounded by grass. I did not even think that there is a chance that the ball cannot be found. To my astonishment after 5 minutes of looking we could not find his golf ball.</p>
  <p>I would like to make a round on the golf course more enjoyable. I would like to help this “fine” golf ball to be found rather than disappear.</p>

  <h2 class="headingsub">Description</h2>

  <p>The project idea is to create a golf ball that can be tracked and more easily found. Two possible methods by which this could be achieved would be through sound or light, or through tracking.</p>
  <p>Sound or light option</p>
  <p>This option involves the golf ball being redesigned to include a speaker or light inside it to be able to use human senses to find it. The ball would play a sound or shine a light for the golfer to hear or see. However, this could impede the quiet nature of golf. Additionally, the effectiveness of this option would be limited as some golfers cannot hear or see well. It would also be difficult to manufacture a light or speaker into the ball with all the strict regulations that are in place for golf balls. Given these insights, this idea would not be optimal.</p>
  <p>Tracking option</p>
  <p>Another option is to include something inside the golf ball to make it possible for a machine to find it. This machine could be a handheld device or a device that is fixed to a golf bag\buggy. It could also be tracked by a smart phone using an app. The golf ball would have a GPS tracker inside it. The device or phone would track the ball and guide the golfer to its location. The location of the ball would be displayed on a course map and as the golfer then arrives in the general area of the ball, an arrow or dot would direct the golfer to the golf ball. Despite the similar difficulties in manufacturing, this option would be more optimal due to the end result being more functional and practical for the user.</p>
  <p>The tracking option is the preferred method of developing this project idea. There are a number of considerations that would need to be addressed for this idea to work effectively. Firstly, the ball would need to conform to ruling regulations. Some of the regulations relate to weight, size, shape and stiffness. Secondly, a GPS tracking chip would need to be made and imbedded into the golf ball that can withstand extreme conditions. Some include withstand high impacts, temperature changes, water and sand. Lastly, an app or tracking device would need to be developed that is user friendly.</p>

  <h2 class="headingsub">Tools and Technologies</h2>

  <p>The two main software and hardware tools required for this project would be the development of a GPS tracking chip to be placed inside the golf ball, and a device or app that the user can use to track the ball’s location.</p>
  <p>GPS inside the golf ball</p>
  <p>The technologies needed to successfully develop the ball would be:</p>
  <p>•	GPS - for tracking</p>
  <p>•	NFC – for charging the ball</p>
  <p>•	Golf ball technology for optimal spin and ball speed</p>
  <p>Device/app</p>
  <p>The software for this would need to be developed to connect to the ball and accurately relay the location of the ball to the user.</p>

  <h2 class="headingsub">Skills Required</h2>

  <p>The skills required would be both in software and hardware fields. The development of the app UI would need skills of coding and programming. The GPS tracking within the app would need to be factored into the app development. The GPS tracking chip would need skills of circuit board design and creation, alongside putting a GPS node on the circuit board. The skill to incorporate NFC charging would also be needed. The skills of designing premium quality golf balls would be required to make the ball a viable replacement for current marketed golf balls whilst not losing performance gains.</p>
  <p>The software for this project is very likely already developed but has not been integrated in this field. It would also be likely that the hardware required is available but again has not been integrated. This would increase the likeliness that this project idea would be very viable.</p>

  <h2 class="headingsub">Outcome</h2>

  <p>If the project is successful, golfers who find it difficult to see their ball, or who often lose their ball will be able to find it easily! Receiving a 2-shot penalty for a lost ball will be no more. This development will have a positive impact on the golfing community as players will enjoy the opportunity to play more often without the hassle and cost of losing of a ball, or multiple. Big companies such as Callaway, TaylorMade and Titleist would most probably want to patent the idea and make a considerable profit from it. It may cause contention amongst professional fields as those who have the trackable ball would be at an advantage. Thus, it may prove difficult to have this ball regulated in competitions as it would need to be approved by PGA associations.</p>
